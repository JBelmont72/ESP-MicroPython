## Prevent PyMakr Auto-Load in Non-MicroPython Folders
Since you mentioned you don’t want PyMakr running in all projects:

Add this to .vscode/settings.json in non-MicroPython folders:
```python
{
  "pycom.pymakr.showStartNotification": false,
  "pycom.pymakr.autoConnect": false,
  "pycom.pymakr.connectOnStartup": false
}
```
Or disable PyMakr in VSCode settings and only enable it per workspace.

## 🧭 3. Tip: Use boot.py for Startup Behavior
If you want the button to control upload behavior at boot, place this logic in boot.py:
     boot.py
from machine import Pin
import os

button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

if not button.value():
    print("Button held at boot — enter safe mode or disable Wi-Fi")
    # os.remove('main.py') or start minimal mode
else:
    print("Normal boot")

# integrate
’m suggesting exactly that: using a physical button press to switch between different modes or run different parts of your MicroPython program.

Let’s integrate your button code into a larger example that gives you a menu or mode switch based on a short press (for toggling something like an LED or sending a message) and optionally a long press (e.g., to run a different client or shut down a service).

✅ Example: Button-Controlled Action Switcher
This example:

Uses GP14 as the button input (active-low).
Waits for a short press to trigger mode_one_action().
Waits for a long press (2 seconds) to trigger mode_two_action().
from machine import Pin
import time

# Set up button
button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

# Debounce helpers
def wait_for_release(timeout=2):
    """Wait for button release or timeout in seconds."""
    start = time.ticks_ms()
    while not button.value():
        if time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_ms(), start) > timeout * 1000:
            return False  # held too long
        time.sleep(0.01)
    return True

def button_pressed():
    return not button.value()  # Active low

# Action placeholders
def mode_one_action():
    print("Short press: Running mode one (e.g., send client message)")

def mode_two_action():
    print("Long press: Running mode two (e.g., stop client / reboot)")

# Main loop
while True:
    if button_pressed():
        press_start = time.ticks_ms()
        time.sleep(0.05)  # debounce
        while not button.value():  # Still holding
            time.sleep(0.01)
        press_duration = time.ticks_diff(time.ticks_ms(), press_start)

        if press_duration < 1500:
            mode_one_action()
        else:
            mode_two_action()

        time.sleep(0.3)  # Post-press delay to avoid bounce
🧠 Suggestions for Actions
You can customize mode_one_action() and mode_two_action() to:

Start/stop UDP or MQTT server/client code
Toggle LED or motor
Change mode in a state machine
Send commands over Wi-Fi
🗂 Tips for Organizing Code
To avoid running everything in one script, you can break up each mode into its own .py file, like:

main.py         # contains the button logic
client_mode.py  # has a start_client() function
server_mode.py  # has a start_server() function
Then in main.py, you can do:

import client_mode
import server_mode

def mode_one_action():
    client_mode.start_client()

def mode_two_action():
    server_mode.start_server()

# A complete setup using both cores for server and client/receiver
a complete set up  because the ESP32 has two cores, you can run both the server and client on one ESP32
The ESP32 has two cores (Core 0 and Core 1), which allows it to run multiple tasks in parallel using MicroPython’s uasyncio or threading (to a limited extent). So, you can run both a server and a client on the same ESP32 — for example:

One core can listen for incoming messages (server behavior).
The other can send messages (client behavior).
Or both behaviors can alternate cooperatively using uasyncio.
Below is a complete MicroPython setup that:

Connects to Wi-Fi.
Sets up a button on GPIO 14.
When button is pressed, it sends a UDP message to another device (or itself).
Also acts as a UDP server that listens for incoming messages and prints them.
✅ MicroPython UDP Server + Client with Button Control (ESP32)
import network
import socket
import uasyncio as asyncio
from machine import Pin
import time

# Wi-Fi credentials
SSID = 'your_ssid'
PASSWORD = 'your_password'

# UDP settings
UDP_PORT = 12345
TARGET_IP = '192.168.1.100'  # Change this to another device or 127.0.0.1 for self
TARGET_PORT = UDP_PORT

# Button setup (active-low)
button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

def button_pressed():
    return not button.value()

# Wi-Fi connect
def connect_wifi():
    wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    wlan.active(True)
    if not wlan.isconnected():
        print('Connecting to WiFi...')
        wlan.connect(SSID, PASSWORD)
        while not wlan.isconnected():
            time.sleep(0.2)
    print('Connected, IP:', wlan.ifconfig()[0])
    return wlan

# Send UDP message when button pressed
async def button_task():
    last_state = 1
    udp = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    while True:
        current_state = button.value()
        if last_state == 1 and current_state == 0:
            print("Button pressed — sending message!")
            udp.sendto(b"Hello from ESP32!", (TARGET_IP, TARGET_PORT))
            await asyncio.sleep(0.3)  # debounce
        last_state = current_state
        await asyncio.sleep(0.05)

# UDP Server
async def udp_server_task():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
    s.bind(('', UDP_PORT))
    s.setblocking(False)
    print(f"Listening for UDP on port {UDP_PORT}")
    while True:
        try:
            data, addr = s.recvfrom(1024)
            print(f"Received from {addr}: {data.decode()}")
        except Exception:
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)

# Main
async def main():
    connect_wifi()
    await asyncio.gather(button_task(), udp_server_task())

# Run
try:
    asyncio.run(main())
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Stopped.")
🔧 To Run:
Save as main.py on your ESP32.
Adjust the SSID, PASSWORD, and TARGET_IP accordingly.
Open a serial terminal and press the button to send messages.
Messages received by the server will be printed.
🧠 Notes:
This runs both tasks using uasyncio (cooperatively multitasked).
You can even set TARGET_IP = '127.0.0.1' to send messages to itself.
This approach also works beautifully with another ESP32 acting as the other side of the connection.
Would you like a second ESP32 script that only acts as the receiver/server?

✅ Goal:

ESP32 Server with:
A button on GP14 to trigger a special message.
A Wi-Fi socket server listening for clients.
Client (can run from a browser using JavaScript or another ESP32 using MicroPython) that sends messages and receives replies.

🧠 Part 1: ESP32 Server Code (MicroPython)

This ESP32 acts as a server and listens for a client connection over Wi-Fi. Pressing the button sends a special message.

📂 File: main.py (save at top level of ESP32)
import network
import socket
import time
from machine import Pin

# --- Wi-Fi Setup ---
ssid = 'YourSSID'
password = 'YourPassword'

wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
wlan.connect(ssid, password)

print("Connecting to Wi-Fi", end='')
while not wlan.isconnected():
    print('.', end='')
    time.sleep(0.5)
print("\nConnected. IP:", wlan.ifconfig()[0])

# --- Button Setup ---
button = Pin(14, Pin.IN, Pin.PULL_UP)

def button_pressed():
    return not button.value()

# --- Socket Server Setup ---
addr = socket.getaddrinfo('0.0.0.0', 1234)[0][-1]
server = socket.socket()
server.bind(addr)
server.listen(1)
print('Listening on', addr)

# --- Main Loop ---
while True:
    print('Waiting for connection...')
    conn, client_addr = server.accept()
    print('Client connected from', client_addr)

    while True:
        try:
            data = conn.recv(1024)
            if not data:
                break
            message = data.decode().strip()
            print(f"Received from client: {message}")
            
            if button_pressed():
                print("Button pressed on ESP32!")
                conn.send(b"BUTTON PRESSED\n")
            else:
                reply = f"Echo: {message}\n"
                conn.send(reply.encode())
        except OSError:
            break
    conn.close()
🧠 Part 2: ESP32 Client (MicroPython)

If you're using another ESP32 (or Pico W), this is a simple MicroPython client that connects to the server and sends messages.

📂 File: client.py (on second device)
import network
import socket
import time

# --- Wi-Fi Setup ---
ssid = 'YourSSID'
password = 'YourPassword'

wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
wlan.connect(ssid, password)

print("Connecting to Wi-Fi", end='')
while not wlan.isconnected():
    print('.', end='')
    time.sleep(0.5)
print("\nConnected. IP:", wlan.ifconfig()[0])

# --- Connect to Server ---
server_ip = '192.168.1.100'  # Replace with the server's IP
port = 1234

s = socket.socket()
s.connect((server_ip, port))
print("Connected to server.")

# --- Send Messages ---
while True:
    s.send(b"Hello Server\n")
    data = s.recv(1024)
    print("Reply:", data.decode())
    time.sleep(2)
🌐 Browser Client (Optional JavaScript Demo)

If you'd like a browser-based client using HTML + JavaScript (run from a file on your computer):

📂 File: client.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>ESP32 Client</h2>
<button onclick="sendMessage()">Send Message</button>
<pre id="response"></pre>

<script>
async function sendMessage() {
  const response = await fetch("http://192.168.1.100:1234", {
    method: "POST",
    body: "Hello from browser",
    mode: "no-cors"
  });
  document.getElementById("response").textContent = "Message sent!";
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
⚠️ Note: This requires you to run a simple HTTP server on the ESP32 instead of a raw TCP socket, which we can adapt if you prefer this route.
✅ Summary

The server ESP32 handles both button input and client communication.
The client can be a second ESP32 or a browser.
The ESP32 server uses MicroPython and works on a single core, but can be optimized using uasyncio or dual-core C if needed.
Let me know which client (MicroPython ESP32 or browser) you want to focus on next or if you'd like to try this over WebSockets or MQTT.

Understanding pot.atten(ADC.ATTN_11DB)
What is pot.atten()?
The pot.atten() function is used to set the attenuation level for the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) on the ESP32 microcontroller. This function allows you to define the voltage range that the ADC will read.
What does ADC.ATTN_11DB mean?
ADC.ATTN_11DB: This setting allows the ADC to read a full voltage range of 0 to 3.3 volts.
The "11dB" refers to the attenuation level, which effectively increases the maximum voltage that can be measured by the ADC.
Why is it important?
Setting the correct attenuation is crucial for accurate readings. If the input voltage exceeds the specified range, it can damage the microcontroller or lead to incorrect readings.
Summary of Attenuation Levels
ATTENUATION LEVEL	FULL RANGE VOLTAGE
ADC.ATTN_0DB	1.2V
ADC.ATTN_2_5DB	1.5V
ADC.ATTN_6DB	2.0V
ADC.ATTN_11DB	3.3V
Using pot.atten(ADC.ATTN_11DB) ensures that the ESP32 can accurately read voltages up to 3.3V, which is essential for many applications, including reading values from sensors like potentiometers
