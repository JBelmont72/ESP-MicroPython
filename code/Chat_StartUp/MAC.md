to find MAC address
To get the MAC address of an ESP32 using Pymakr in VS Code, you can use the following MicroPython code snippet:
 microcontrollerslab.com randomnerdtutorials.com
python
Copy Code
import network
sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
print('MAC address:', sta_if.config('mac'))
Alternatively, from the terminal on macOS, you can connect to the ESP32 and run the same code in the REPL to retrieve the MAC address.
Finding the MAC Address of ESP32
Using Pymakr in VS Code
Install Pymakr: Ensure you have the Pymakr extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
Connect ESP32: Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.
Open Pymakr Console: In VS Code, open the Pymakr console.
Run Command: Type the following command in the console to get the MAC address:
python
Copy Code
import network
sta_if = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
print(sta_if.config('mac'))
View Output: The MAC address will be displayed in the console.
Using Terminal on macOS
Connect ESP32: Connect your ESP32 board to your Mac.
Open Terminal: Launch the Terminal application.
Install esptool: If you haven't installed it yet, run:
bash
Copy Code
pip install esptool
Find Serial Port: Identify the serial port for your ESP32. Use:
bash
Copy Code
ls /dev/tty.*
Run Command: Use the following command to connect to the ESP32 and retrieve the MAC address:
bash
Copy Code
esptool.py --port /dev/tty.usbmodemXXXX read_mac
Replace tty.usbmodemXXXX with your actual port name.
View Output: The MAC address will be displayed in the terminal.
This process allows you to easily find the MAC address of your ESP32 using either Pymakr in VS Code or directly from the terminal on macOS.
